Real-time Java Message Service (JMS) Source To Stream Sink Application Configuration
====================================================================================

The ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifact can be used to create an Application that reads from a 
real-time Source and pass it to a Sink to be processed further.

In this example, we will poll messages from a Java Message Service (JMS) source in real time and 
use a Stream Sink to write the messages to a CDAP Stream.

The ``config.json`` contains a sample Application configuration that you can use to accomplish this task. 

Our sample Application uses these components:

- The ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifact, since we want to perform ETL in real time
- JMS source, using the implementation of JMS from Apache ActiveMQ, version 5.11.1
- Stream sink to hold the incoming messages to be processed by a downstream program such as a CDAP Flow

You can create and start the Application by using the CDAP CLI (or you can use the UI for a more visual approach).

The real time JMS source uses a generic JMS interface to communicate with a JMS broker, 
so the source requires that the JMS interfaces 
be implemented, in order to function as a separate plugin.

One important thing to remember you need to use the identical version of JMS for both the client 
and the target server to ensure 
that the message format is respected when the JMS source start polling messages.

The real time JMS source requires an additional plugin jar that bundles all JMS-specific implementations 
and the dependencies into a JAR file. 
For Apache ActiveMQ, we will be using the ``activemq-all-5.11.1.jar`` file that contains most of the required dependencies.

For each additional plugin JAR, there should be an accompanying JSON file, with the same name 
as the JAR name but with the ``.json`` extension, to describe the plugin. 
This is so the application will know of it and load it as part of the plugin class loader.

The JAR and the JSON counterpart files should be put in the ``artifacts`` directory.

There are additional jars that should be copied into the ``artifacts`` directory. 
These JARs will be available as part of the combined class loaders for all real-time plugins.
For example, for Apache ActiveMQ, we need to copy a JAR containing the JMS specifications API. 

Available Properties for JMS Source
===================================

To configure the source, these properties are required:

#. ``jms.destination.name``: Name of the JMS destination (either Topic or Queue name) to receive messages

#. ``jms.messages.receive``: Maximum number of messages to be retrieved per poll; the default value is 50

#. ``jms.factory.initial``: The fully-qualified classname of the factory class that will create an initial context

#. ``jms.provider.url``: The URL of the JMS server broker to connect to

#. ``ConnectionFactory``: Change the format of the name for the connectionfactory in JMS source plugin. 
   The default value is ConnectionFactory

In addition to the properties expected by the JMS source, you can pass additional key-value pairs of properties that 
will be passed through to underlying JNDI initial context to configure the implementation of the JMS APIs.

For example, the Apache ActiveMQ requires that the Topic or Queue name be set as ``topic.<destination name>`` 
or ``queue.<destination name>`` 
property key names in order for the JNDI context to be resolved.

The ``config.json`` file included shows the Application configuration file with sample values for the JMS source properties.

The JMS APIs Implementation Plugin JSON Configuration File
===========================================================

As mentioned above, the JMS source requires an additional plugin that actually performs the 
execution of polling messages from the target server.

The guide provides the ``activemq-all-5.11.1.json`` file as an example based on the Apache ActiveMQ, version 5.11.1:

#. ``type``: Type of the plugin; as of now, it has to be ``JMSProvider``
#. ``name``: Name of this plugin; as of now, it has to be ``java.naming.factory.initial``
#. `className`: Fully qualified name of the main class for the intial context factory implementation. 
   For ActiveMQ it is ``org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory``
#. `description`: The description of this plugin

Available Properties for Stream Sink
====================================

To configure the sink, these properties are required:

#. ``name``:  Name of the stream to output to; the stream will be created if it does not already exist
#. ``headers.field``: Name of the header field from the incoming events to be processed by the Sink
#. ``body.field``: Nme of the body field from the incoming events to be processed by the Sink

In this Adapter, the JMS source will send events to the Stream sink in the ``StructuredRecord`` format, 
with the data stored in a body field called ``message``.

The ``config.json`` file sets ``body.field`` as ``message`` to let the Stream sink know to retrieve 
the data from the ``message`` field of the incoming ``StructuredRecord`` events.
